Webhooks will allow you to detect when a specified event occurs. Supported event types include:

* `element_completed` → When a step is completed

* `member_joining_offer` →  When a member is added to an offer

* `new_payment` → When a member initiates a new payment (whether it is on a one-time offer price, a multiple installment price, or a subscription)

* `member_inactivity` → Will trigger at the same time as the member inactivity notification from SchoolMaker

* `gamification_level_passed`  → Which will trigger when a level is passed in the community gamification feature

<Warning>
  The Webhook pages are still being worked on, naming is not definitive.
