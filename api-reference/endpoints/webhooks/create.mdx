Webhooks will allow you to detect when a specified event occurs. Supported event types include:

* `element_completed` → When a step is completed

* `member_joining_offer` →  When a member is added to an offer
  - **extra_parameters**:
    - `offerFilter` → An offer ID or multiple offer IDs separated by commas. This event will only trigger if the member is added to an offer that matches the filter.
* `new_payment` → When a member initiates a new payment (whether it is on a one-time offer price, a multiple installment price, or a subscription)

* `member_inactivity` → Will trigger at the same time as the member inactivity notification from SchoolMaker

* `gamification_level_passed`  → Which will trigger when a level is passed in the community gamification feature
  - **extra_parameters**:
    - `activeLevels` → A comma-separated list of level numbers. This event will only trigger if the member has passed a level that is in the list.


To see the payload for each event, please refer to the [Webhooks Payload](/api-reference/endpoints/webhooks/payload) page.
