Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when specific events occur in your SchoolMaker instance. When an event is triggered, we'll send a POST request to your configured webhook URL with a JSON payload containing event details.

## Request Format

All webhook notifications are sent as POST requests with the following characteristics:
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Request body: JSON object containing event data
- Webhook URL: The endpoint URL you configured to receive notifications

<Warning>
  Make sure your webhook endpoint can handle POST requests and process JSON payloads.

<Warning>
  The Webhook pages are still being worked on, naming is not definitive.
