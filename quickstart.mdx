## Authentication

<Note>
  Only schools on the **Pro** and **Business** plans will get access to the SchoolMaker API. You can upgrade your plan from your school's billing settings or contact our support team if you want to get API access.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Your SchoolMaker API key should never be used client side or exposed to your end users.
</Warning>

Start here if you want to use the SchoolMaker API to manage your members or track your school activity.

<Accordion title="Authentication Steps" defaultOpen="false">
  To get started, you’ll need an API key. Go to `Settings` -\> `Integration & API` in your SchoolMaker settings and scroll down to the API Section.

  ![](/get_api_key.png)

  You will be able to copy your API key by clicking on the clipboard button.

  <Info>
    When making an API call, you will need to add an Authorization header and set the API key as a Bearer token.
  </Info>
  Here’s an example Curl request (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own API key):

  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://schoolmaker.co/api/v1/products \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
</Accordion>

## Rate Limiting

<Warning>
  Exceeding rate limits may temporarily block your API access. If you hit the limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests response. Handle limits carefully.
</Warning>

The SchoolMaker API uses rate limits to manage request volumes and ensure fair usage.

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting Details" defaultOpen="false">
  **Rate Limit Headers**:

  Each API response includes headers to help you track your usage:

  - X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed per period.
  - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests left in the current period.
  - X-RateLimit-Reset: Time when the limit resets (epoch time).

  **Rate Limiting Rules**:

  General API Requests: 5 requests per second per IP.

## Debugging

Sometimes things go wrong. Here are some tips to help you debug your API requests.

<Accordion title="Debugging Steps" defaultOpen="false">
  If you are having trouble with the API, we recommend using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test your requests.

  1. Dealing with “Not Authenticated” Codes:
     - Make sure you are using an API key from the SchoolMaker "Integrations & API" settings page and that you are including it in your requests.
     - Your API key should be included in the “Authorization” header of your request, following the format “Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY”.
  2. Authorization Header:
     - Ensure that you are correctly including the “Authorization” header in your requests. The value of this header should follow the format “Bearer YOUR_API_KEY”.
  3. Handling 400-level Responses:
     - 400-level responses typically indicate that there was a problem with the request. The response body will contain more information about what went wrong, so be sure to check it for details.
     - Check on your request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and ensure that you are using the correct one for the endpoint you are trying to access.

  If you have followed these steps and are still experiencing issues, don’t hesitate to [reach out to the SchoolMaker team](mailto:support@schoolmaker.co) for further assistance.

## Where to find IDs?
