## Rate Limiting Overview
<Warning>
Exceeding rate limits may temporarily block your API access. If you hit the limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests response. Handle limits carefully.
</Warning>

The SchoolMaker API uses rate limits to manage request volumes and ensure fair usage.

## Rate Limit Headers
Each API response includes headers to help you track your usage:
- X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed per period.
- X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests left in the current period.
- X-RateLimit-Reset: Time when the limit resets (epoch time).

## Rate Limiting Rules
General API Requests: 5 requests per second per IP.
